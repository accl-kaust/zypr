ZyCAP
=====

ZyCAP is a **custom ICAP controller for high speed and efficient partial reconfiguration (PR)** on Xilinx’s Zynq SoCs. It has a hardware IP core, which can be used within the Xilinx’s XPS environment or Vivado tool-flow to integrate with the Zynq processing system (PS). 

About
=====

The ZyCAP driver takes care of low level reconfiguration operations, bitstream caching and bitstream memory management. The user is provided with API functions that can be used for software-driven reconfiguration from the PS. Currently, the design has been verified on the Digilent Zed Board and the Zynq ZC-702 platforms, with the Standalone OS and the Xillinux kernel. These working examples can be directly downloaded from the repository hosted at https://github.com/archntu/zycap.git.
